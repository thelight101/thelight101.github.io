        ### Paragraphs

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        > **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

       ## Arduino Projects: Bluetooth Micro Servo and Ambulance Siren

       ### 1. Bluetooth Micro Servo Project  
       This project allows controlling a micro servo motor via a Bluetooth module. The user can change the servo motor's angle using a mobile application or the serial monitor.

       #### Components Used:
       - Arduino (UNO/Nano/Pro Mini)
       - SG90 Micro Servo Motor
       - HC-05 Bluetooth Module
       - 9V Battery or USB Power Supply

       #### Working Principle:
       When a Bluetooth signal is sent from a phone or computer, the servo motor moves to the specified angles.

       [Download Project](/assets/projects/Bluetooth_Micro_Servo.sb2)

       ### 2. Arduino Ambulance Siren Project  
       This project creates an ambulance siren effect using a buzzer. The sound frequency is changed using PWM in the code.

       #### Components Used:
       - Arduino (UNO/Nano)
       - Buzzer (Piezo or Speaker)
       - 9V Battery or USB Power Supply

       #### Working Principle:
       Arduino generates an ambulance siren sound by changing the buzzer's frequency at specific intervals.
